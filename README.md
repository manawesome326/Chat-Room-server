# Lit-Room-server

Now with cool stuff like:

- no longer roasts your battery when somebody leaves
- usernames
- custom max user numbers
- /quit command if you ever wanted to do that for some reason
- probably some other stuff I forgot about
- /help
- you can now be god
- god doesn't want you to be god and stops you from doing it
